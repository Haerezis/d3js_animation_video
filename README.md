# d3js_animation_video
Create video (or just gif) from D3 animation using PhantomJS,D3, imagemagick and ffmpeg

This a proof of concept using PhantomJS to give D3 a complete DOM and allow us to write svg file from the svg tag handled by D3.
Imagemagick is used to convert these svg to png, and ffmpeg create a video from these png.
